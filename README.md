# CoderAcademy: 'Movies' - Sequel DB + Server + ERB

<img src="docs/screen.png" width="500">

An exercise during my Coder Academy Bootcamp in 2018. This is my first time creating a WEBrick HTTPServlet, and properly using Sequel Models. Also my first time with ERB, so that was kinda neat.

Found the movies.json somewhere on google, it had a bunch of garbage, but it'll do!

## Getting Started

Clone the repo, and navigate to the directory in terminal. When you're there:

```bash
bundle install
```

once that's done, run the server using:

```bash
ruby main.rb
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:3000] to check out the good stuff :)

### Prerequisites

- Ruby
- SQLite3
- Sequel
